Scrimba Module 7 - API

Learn fetch through building a blog, using JSON placeholder for title and body.

Course tutor challenges students to add CSS styling along the way. This is my take on it.

Used a great Medium article to learn about adding CSS classes and appending child to parent.

Plus, used ul/li, whereas Scrimba had a simpler 'add everything to DOM in one element with `innerHTML`'
